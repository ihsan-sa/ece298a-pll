# Design SDC for tt_um_ihsan_sa_pll, sourced after LibreLane's base.sdc,
# which already defines the primary clock clk (spec clock.period_ns, 80 ns).
# Names are the flat (post-synth) netlist's: yosys flattening keeps one of
# a net's hierarchical aliases, so each clock net is looked up by every
# alias it can carry, and the clock goes on the driving flop's output pin.
# No leading wildcard: CTS adds clknet_*/clkbuf_* nets that end in the same
# names, and a pattern matching them gives a generated clock several masters.

# (clk_pre at 20 ns) met it with 3.3 ns of setup slack at ss.
